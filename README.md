WhatFix Exercise Angular1.3 Sudoku Validator

I have hosted the data.txt file in the localhost:8000;
As i have developed this over Mac, hence i used the command in the terminal :  python -m SimpleHTTPServer, this will by default run an http server over port 8000 (This command will only work for Mac and linux , for windows you can run anyserver on any port, just root of this application should be the same)
The UI is not completed properly, just functionality is totaly working.
